    "This privacy policy applies to Knobull, Inc. services, applications " +
    "and other products that link to this privacy policy." +
    "\n\nThe Knobull Team is committed to protecting the privacy of its " +
    "user community. The intent of this privacy policy is to insure users " +
    "that we will not gather information about individuals who interact " +
    "with our services." +
    "\n\nKnobull prevents leakage by default. Instead, when you click on " +
    "a link on our site, we route (redirect) that request in such a way " +
    "so that it does not send your interface to other sites. The other " +
    "sites will still know that you visited but they will not know what " +
    "connection you entered beforehand." +
    "\n\nOther search engines and blog sites save your interface history. " +
    "Usually your connections are saved along with the date and time of " +
    "the interface, some information about your computer (e.g. your IP " +
    "address, User agents and often a unique identifier stored in a " +
    "browser cookies) and if you are logged in, your account information " +
    "(e.g. name and email address). Also, with this information your " +
    "interfaces can be tied together. This means someone can see all your " +
    "activity, not just one isolated interface. You can usually find out " +
    "a lot about a person from this history." +
    "\n\nFor these reasons, Knobull takes the approach to not collect any " +
    "personal information. The decisions of whether and how to comply " +
    "with law enforcement requests, whether and how to anonymize data, " +
    "and how to best protect your information from hackers are out of our " +
    "hands. Your personal history is safe with us because it cannot be " +
    "tied to you in any way." +
    "\n\nWe save blog usersâ€™s email address but again, not in a " +
    "personally identifiable way, as we do not store IP addresses or " +
    "unique User agent strings. We use aggregate, non-personal data to " +
    "improve our service. If you contact us, it may be stored in our " +
    "email. However, you can give anonymous feedback (by not entering " +
    "your email or other personal info on the feedback form)." +
    "\n\nAt times we do add an affiliate code to some eCommerce sites " +
    "(e.g. Amazon & eBay) that results in small commissions being paid " +
    "back to Knobull when our users make purchases at those sites. We do " +
    "not use any third parties to do the code insertion, and we do not " +
    "work with any sites that share personally identifiable information " +
    "(e.g. name, address, etc.) via their affiliate programs. This means " +
    "that no information is shared from Knobull to the sites, and the " +
    "only information that is collected from this process is product " +
    "information. This is not tied to any particular user and we do not " +
    "save or store such information. This whole affiliate process is part " +
    "of our business model to reduce promotions on Knobull. These native " +
    "promotions are blended into the content of Blog articles and will " +
    "always be unobtrusive to readers." +
    "\n\nAlso, like anyone else, we will comply with court ordered legal " +
    "requests. However, in our case, we don't expect any because there is " +
    "nothing useful to give them since we don't collect any personal " +
    "information." +
    "\n\nPlease note that this policy applies only to Knobull, Inc. " +
    "services and not to the sites of other companies or organizations to " +
    "which we provide links or to any software that may be downloaded " +
    "from our site. All research expert organizations that use our blog " +
    "post development support and distribution services will be fully " +
    "informed of our security policy and will understand that continued " +
    "use of our support are contingent on their compliance." +
    "\n\nLynn Bentley, President, wrote this policy and if you have " +
    "questions or input, please submit feedback."
